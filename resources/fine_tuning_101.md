## What is Fine Tuning?

Fine Tuning is the process of adapting a pre-trained language model for specific tasks or domains by further training it on a smaller, targeted dataset. This approach leverages the general knowledge and capabilities the model acquired during its initial pre-training phase while optimizing its performance for particular applications.

During fine tuning, most of the model's parameters are updated, but at a lower learning rate than initial training. This allows the model to retain its foundational knowledge while adapting to new contexts.

---

## Why Fine Tune?

Fine Tuning addresses several limitations of pre-trained models:

- **Domain-specific needs**: Pre-trained models have broad knowledge but may lack depth in specialized fields like medicine, law, or technical domains. Fine Tuning can teach models domain-specific terminology, conventions, and knowledge.

- **Task specialization**: General-purpose models might not excel at specific tasks like sentiment analysis, text classification, or summarization without additional training.

- **Improved performance**: Fine Tuning typically yields better results than prompting alone for targeted applications, especially when consistent, reliable outputs are required.

- **Reduced prompt engineering**: A well-fine tuned model often requires less elaborate prompting to achieve desired results.

- **Adaptation to organizational style**: Organizations can align model outputs with their communication style, tone, and guidelines.

## Fine Tuning vs. Prompting vs. Training from Scratch: When to Use What?

### Prompting

**Best for**: Quick implementations, general tasks, limited resources, or when flexibility is needed  
**Advantages**: No additional training, immediate deployment, adaptable on-the-fly  
**Limitations**: May require complex prompt engineering, can be inconsistent, consumes token budget  
**Use when**: You need quick solutions, have limited data, or requirements change frequently

---

### Fine Tuning

**Best for**: Specialized applications, consistent outputs, improved efficiency  
**Advantages**: Better performance on specific tasks, reduced prompt length, more consistent results  
**Limitations**: Requires quality training data, computational resources, and expertise  
**Use when**: You have a well-defined use case, sufficient domain-specific data, and need reliable performance

---

### Training from Scratch

**Best for**: Highly specialized applications, proprietary systems, or when privacy is paramount  
**Advantages**: Complete control over model architecture and training, no reliance on external foundations  
**Limitations**: Extremely resource-intensive, requires massive datasets and expertise  
**Use when**: Pre-trained models fundamentally cannot meet your needs, you have massive computational resources, or you're developing novel architectures

---

In practice, many organizations start with prompting to validate use cases, then move to fine tuning as requirements solidify. Training from scratch remains rare outside of large AI research organizations.

- **Large models (> 7B parameters)**: Need multiple high-end GPUs, TPUs, or specialized hardware  

**Alternative approaches for resource constraints**:
- Parameter-efficient fine tuning (LoRA, QLoRA, etc.)
- Quantization to reduce memory footprint
- Gradient checkpointing to trade computation for memory
- Cloud-based solutions (e.g., Google Colab Pro, AWS, Azure)

---

### Data Requirements

Effective fine tuning depends heavily on your data:

- **Quality**: Clean, relevant, and representative of your target task  
- **Quantity**:
  - Classification: At least 100+ examples per class  
  - Generation: 1,000+ examples recommended  
  - More complex tasks may need significantly more data  
- **Format**: Typically JSON or CSV with clear inputs and desired outputs  
- **Diversity**: Cover the range of scenarios the model should handle  
- **Preprocessing**: Tokenization, cleaning, and formatting for the specific model  
- **Train/validation split**: To monitor overfitting during training  

*Data preparation is often the most critical and time-consuming part of successful fine tuning. Even the best models can't overcome poor quality training data.*
