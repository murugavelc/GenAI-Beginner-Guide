# Part 8: Multi-Agent Systems

---

So far, we’ve talked a lot about what makes a **single agent** act — from **tools** and **RAG** to **memory** and **planning**.

But what if your agentic pipeline needs to:  
- Parallelize tasks to speed things up  
- Use different agent personas for different parts of a task  
- Break up complexity across specialized units, like in a team  

That’s where **multi-agent systems** come in.

---

## Why Use Multi-Agent Systems?

Sometimes, a single agent just can’t cut it because the problem demands **scale**, **specialization**, or **parallel thinking**.

**Examples:**
- Generating a marketing strategy that needs **market insights**, **legal review**, and **creative suggestions**.  
- Building a compliance assistant that needs to **extract information**, **flag risks**, and **cross-check policies**.  
- Automating a sales process where **one agent** talks to the user, **another** enriches data, and **a third** handles follow-ups.  

Could you do this with one beefy agent?  
**Maybe.**

But splitting it into **multiple, specialized agents** can enable:  
- **Parallelization** → Agents work on parts of a task simultaneously  
- **Specialization** → One agent is great at legalese, another at writing emails  
- **Tooling independence** → Each agent can have its own tools and memory

## Flat vs Hierarchical Agent Coordination

All multi-agent systems need some way to **coordinate**.  
Two common communication patterns:

### 1. Hierarchical Patterns (More Controllable)

An **orchestrator agent** delegates subtasks to others.  
It sees the full picture and controls the flow.

**Use when:**
- Tasks can be clearly decomposed  
- You want tight control  
- You have known agent roles (e.g., summarizer, generator, checker)  

**Think:** enterprise workflows, tool suites, parallel pipelines.

---

### 2. Flat Patterns (More Dynamic)

Agents talk to each other as **peers** — no boss.

**Use when:**
- Tasks need creativity or debate  
- You want agents to evaluate each other  
- There’s no one “correct” answer path  

**Think:** brainstorming, ranking options, multi-view reasoning.

## What Nobody Tells You: Multi-Agent Systems Are a Pain

On paper, this sounds great.  
And sure, you can build quick multi-agent prototypes and have fun with them.  

But for **customer/enterprise** use cases… it’s painful.

Most people read a blog on multi-agent systems and get excited about modularity —  
> “It’s like microservices!” they say.

But **AI agents are not microservices**.

Unlike code, AI models are **non-deterministic**. They don’t always behave the same way.  
Adding more agents means:  
- More **non-determinism** (variation across agents, not just within one)  
- More **memory and state complexity** (who knows what, and when?)  
- Higher **latency** and **cost**  
- More **coordination bugs** and failure points  
- More **collusion**, where agents agree when they shouldn’t (happens more than you think)  

Honestly, I could write a book on how painful it is to get multi-agent systems working reliably.

## So… Should You Use Them?

My personal rule:  
> **In the enterprise, don’t start with multi-agents. Start with one.**

Let that **one agent** fail — empirically (via eval metrics) or operationally — before you scale.

From my experience, **70%+ of enterprise use cases** work just fine with a single well-designed agent — one that uses **tools**, **memory**, **RAG**, and **planning**.

---

### Multi-agent systems shine when:
- The task is big enough to need **parallel execution**  
- You need **clear specialization**  
- You want **creative debate**, evaluation, or distributed decision-making  

Even then, you need **strong design** — especially around **memory**, **state**, and **communication protocols**.

---

## Final Word: Problem First, Always

This has been our mantra from Day 1:  
> Don’t build a multi-agent system because it sounds “agentic.”  
> Build it if — and only if — your problem needs it.

The only way to know?  
- Have the right **metrics**  
- Test  
- Let simpler systems fail first

## Up Next

In the next part, we’ll talk about **real-world agents** and how they function.

PS: We also teach a widely loved course on how to actually build AI systems in this fast-changing environment, using a problem-first approach. It’s designed for PMs, leaders, engineers, decision-makers etc. who are working within real-world constraints. Alumni come from Google, Meta, Apple, Netflix, AWS, Spotify, Snapchat, Deloitte, and more. Our next cohort starts soon. Our next cohort starts soon.
